### Pre-commit hook

Our CI processes require that some commands succeed without warnings or errors. These checks can be performed manually by running:

```bash
cargo xtask test --fail-on-warnings
```

Or, if you would like to run all these checks before each commit, you can install the check as a pre-commit hook:

```bash
cargo xtask install-pre-commit-hook
```
